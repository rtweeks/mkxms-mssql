# Mkxms::Mssql [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/mkxms-mssql.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/mkxms-mssql)

Creates a set of XMigra (https://rubygems.org/gems/xmigra) source files
from a database description XML document (as generated by
[mssql-eyewkas.sql](https://gist.github.com/rtweeks/62d8fb9c6ca3de1195d9/9d38f51f5f02a65e6146875c15714f9138a3b86c)
or a compatible later version).

## Installation

Install it as a gem:

    $ gem install mkxms-mssql

## Usage

Run `mkxms-mssql [-o DEST_DIR] [DB_DESCRIPTION_XML_FILE]`

## Project Status

The 1.x series of releases is intended to incrementally include support for
additional Microsoft SQL Server features.  As of version 1.1, the following
features are NOT supported by this program (although they may be supported
by XMigra):
  
  * Partition functions and partition schemes
  * XML schema collections
  * Fulltext indexes
  * Rules
  * DDL Triggers
  * Spatial indexes
  * Service Broker configuration
  
Any elements in the database description XML relating to the features above
(or any other feature not supported by this tool) will result in an unknown
method error from this tool.  This tool is definitely still under development!
If your database doesn't involve any of the features listed here (or you're
willing to work around those it does), great.  If it does, please help make
this tool better -- contribute a pull request or at least open or up-vote an
issue for the feature.
